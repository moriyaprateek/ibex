## Ibex RISC-V Core

Ibex is a production-quality open source 32-bit RISC-V CPU core written in SystemVerilog. The CPU core is heavily parametrizable and well suited for embedded control applications. Ibex is being extensively verified and has seen multiple tape-outs. Ibex supports the Integer (I) or Embedded (E), Integer Multiplication and Division (M), Compressed (C), and B (Bit Manipulation) extension.

## Bloom filter

Bloom is a probabilistic data structure that is used to tell if an element is present in the filter or not. It is needed in applications that do not have a lot of resources, and our project enables us to extend the ISA of the Ibex core to include certain bloom operations such as add, check and reset. This was done as part of the MUMEC PR301 at the Ecole Centrale school of Engineering, Mahindra University.
